# Counterfactual Modeling Brexit Economic Impacts

This work aims to implement a counterfactual analysis of the impact of Brexit on GDP growth through machine learning methods. Prior literature completed in this area has primarily taken the form of traditional statistical or econometric models, but this research aims to leverage trade data within graph machine learning models. Features derived from graph ML embeddings will be used within a model of the treatment effects of Brexit on economic outcomes of both the UK and surrounding European countries. The choice of graph machine learning methods is driven by the ability of these models to better capture spatial and temporal dependencies of the way in which countries’ imports and exports interact with one another. The trade data comes from Harvard’s Growth Lab International Trade Data with information on the quantities of exports and imports for 250 countries and territories for 20 categories of goods and covers years 1962 - 2021. This data is free, publicly available, and meant to be used for economic analysis and is originally sourced from the UN Comtrade database. Other data about country socioeconomic characteristics will be obtained from the World Databank. By quantifying the amount by which GDP growth has changed, the true impact of Brexit can be understood and used to analyze this and potential future policies.
